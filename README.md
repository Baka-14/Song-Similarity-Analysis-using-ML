# 3-2 Project on Song Similarity 
### The project explores song similarity analysis through the utilization of a Music Information Retrieval (MIR) toolkit and advanced data analysis techniques. By extracting various features from songs and employing feature selection methods, a subset of optimal features is identified. t-SNE, is applied to overcome the curse of dimensionality by reducing the feature space. Subsequently, the Fuzzy C Means algorithm is utilized to assess song similarity, leveraging the reduced-dimensional representation obtained from t-SNE. The resulting clusters are then visualized using the t-SNE algorithm, enabling a comprehensive understanding of the underlying structures and characteristics that contribute to song similarity. This comprehensive approach provides valuable insights into the underlying structures and characteristics that contribute to song similarity, aiding musicologists, researchers, and music recommendation systems in organizing and understanding vast song collections.![image](https://github.com/Baka-14/3-2-Project-Song-Similarity/assets/73593914/a96e1a33-8226-43de-8fa8-f74508ea54bb)
